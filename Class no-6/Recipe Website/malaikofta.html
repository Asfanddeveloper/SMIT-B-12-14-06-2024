        <h2>Discriptions</h2>

        <blockquote>
            Malai Kofta Curry is a rich and creamy North Indian dish that consists of deep-fried vegetable balls (koftas) simmered in a flavorful and luxurious gravy. This dish is often reserved for special occasions due to its rich taste and decadent nature. The koftas are made with a combination of mashed potatoes, paneer, and various spices, while the curry is a smooth blend of tomatoes, cream, and aromatic spices.

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    
    <h3>For Koftas:</h3>
    
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine grated paneer, mashed potatoes, cornflour, chopped green chilies, grated ginger, garam masala, and salt.</li>
        <li>Mix well to form a smooth dough. If the mixture feels too soft, add a bit more cornflour to bind it.</li>
        <li>Take a small portion of the mixture, flatten it slightly, and place a few chopped cashews and raisins in the center. Roll it into a ball, ensuring the filling is covered completely.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining mixture.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Fry the koftas until they are golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels and set aside.</li>
    
    
    <h3>For Gravy:</h3>
    
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, bay leaf, cloves, and cardamom pods. Sauté for a minute until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato puree and cook until the oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream or malai and stir well to combine. Cook for another 5-7 minutes on low heat.</li>
        <li>Add sugar to balance the flavors. Adjust salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Gently add the fried koftas to the gravy and simmer for a few minutes to allow the koftas to soak up the flavors.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
    
    
    <h3>To Serve:</h3>
    
        <li>Serve the Malai Kofta Curry hot with naan, roti, or steamed basmati rice.</li>
