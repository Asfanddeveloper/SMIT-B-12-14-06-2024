        <h2>Discriptions</h2>

        <blockquote>
            White Mutton Pulao, also known as Safed Mutton Pulao, is a delicate and fragrant rice dish that hails from the Indian subcontinent. Unlike traditional pulaos, this version is characterized by its light and subtle flavors, often achieved without the use of heavy spices or colorings. Tender pieces of mutton are simmered in a blend of aromatic spices and yogurt, which not only tenderizes the meat but also imparts a creamy texture to the dish. The basmati rice is then cooked to perfection in this flavorful broth, resulting in a delectable meal that is both comforting and satisfying. White Mutton Pulao is typically garnished with fried onions, fresh coriander, and a squeeze of lemon, making it a perfect dish for festive occasions or a special family dinner.
